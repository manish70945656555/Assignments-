    "Q6- What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "Ans:-Train-test-validation split is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate and test the performance of a model.\n",
    "It involves splitting a dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Training set: The training set is used to train the model. It contains a large portion of the data and is used to teach the\n",
    "model how to make predictions or decisions based on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Validation set: The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It is used to adjust the\n",
    "model's hyperparameters and to prevent overfitting. The hyperparameters are the parameters that are not learned during training,\n",
    "such as the learning rate or the number of layers in the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Testing set: The testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model after training. It is a completely \n",
    "independent dataset that the model has never seen before and is used to estimate the model's generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each subset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Training set: The training set is important because it is used to teach the model how to make predictions or decisions. The \n",
    "larger the training set, the better the model can learn from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Validation set: The validation set is important because it is used to adjust the model's hyperparameters and to prevent\n",
    "overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning\n",
    "from it. The validation set helps to identify when the model is overfitting and to adjust the hyperparameters accordingly.\n",

    "It is a completely independent dataset that the model has never seen before and is used to estimate the model's generalization\n",
