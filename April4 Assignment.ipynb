    "into smaller subsets until the subsets are homogeneous or a stopping criterion is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction, the algorithm follows a path down the decision tree, starting at the root node, where it evaluates the\n",
    "input features against a condition. Based on the condition, it selects one of the branches that leads to another node. The \n",

    "Q2. Provide a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The decision tree classification algorithm works by recursively partitioning the feature space into smaller and smaller \n",
    "regions. The algorithm uses a greedy approach to find the best split for each node in the tree. The goal of the split is to \n",
    "maximize the purity of the resulting subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purity of a subset is measured using an impurity measure, such as the Gini impurity or entropy. The impurity measures \n",
    "range from 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect purity, and 1 representing maximum impurity. The impurity measure is calculated \n",
    "as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini impurity = 1 - (p1^2 + p2^2 + ... + pk^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy = -p1log2(p1) - p2log2(p2) - ... - pklog2(pk)\n",
    "\n",
    "where pi is the proportion of instances in the subset that belong to class i.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the best split for a node, the algorithm considers all possible splits on all possible features. For each split, it \n",
    "calculates the impurity measure of the resulting subsets, and selects the split that maximizes the information gain, which is\n",
    "defined as the difference between the impurity of the parent node and the weighted average of the impurity of the child nodes. The information gain is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Information gain = Impurity(parent) - [Weighted average] Impurity(children)\n",
    "\n",
    "where the weighted average is calculated based on the number of instances in each child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the best split is selected, the algorithm recursively applies the same process to each child node until a stopping \n",
    "criterion is met, such as the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of instances per leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the decision tree classification algorithm uses the impurity measure and information gain to recursively partition\n",
    "the feature space into smaller and smaller regions, resulting in a tree-like structure that can be used for prediction."
