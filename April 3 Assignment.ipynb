    "Q1. Explain the concept of precision and recall in the context of classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Precision and recall are two common evaluation metrics used in the context of classification models. Precision is \n",
    "the fraction of relevant instances among the total number of instances that are classified as positive. In other words,\n",
    "it measures how accurate the model is in identifying positive instances. Recall, on the other hand, is the fraction of \n",
    "relevant instances that are correctly classified as positive, out of all the positive instances in the dataset. In other\n",

    "The F1 score gives equal weight to both precision and recall, which means that it provides a balanced measure of the \n",
    "model's overall performance. The F1 score ranges between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance. \n",
    "The F1 score is different from precision and recall because it takes into account both metrics and provides a single\n",

    "Ans:-ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) are evaluation metrics used to assess the \n",
    "performance of classification models. ROC is a graphical plot that illustrates the tradeoff between true positive rate \n",
    "(TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) for different classification thresholds. AUC is the area under the ROC curve, which\n",

    "Ans:-The choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific problem and the requirements of the application. For example,\n",
