    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that store data in a way that does not rely on \n",
    "the traditional relational model used by SQL databases. Instead, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including \n",

    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is highly unstructured or variable in\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans:-MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that offers a range of features and capabilities. Some of the\n",
    "key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON) that can contain\n",
    "complex hierarchies of data. This makes it easy to store and manage complex data structures, such as arrays and nested \n",
    "documents, without the need for complex JOIN operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)High Scalability: MongoDB's architecture is designed to be highly scalable, making it well-suited for large-scale, \n",
    "high-traffic applications. It can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to a cluster, allowing it to handle large\n",
    "volumes of data and traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Dynamic Schema: MongoDB allows for dynamic schema design, which means that documents in a collection can have different\n",
    "fields and data types. This makes it easy to handle data that is constantly changing or evolving, without the need for\n",
    "costly schema migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Rich Query Language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that allows developers to perform complex queries on their \n",
    "data, including geospatial queries and text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Secondary Indexes: MongoDB supports the creation of secondary indexes, which can greatly improve query performance by \n",
    "allowing queries to be optimized based on the values in specific fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports replication and high availability through its built-in replication\n",
    "and sharding capabilities. This allows for automatic failover and recovery in the event of node failures, ensuring high \n",
    "availability and data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)Aggregation Framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework allows for complex data analysis and aggregation operations to\n",
    "be performed directly within the database. This can greatly simplify data analysis and reduce the need for complex ETL\n",
    "processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's flexible data model, high scalability, dynamic schema, and rich query capabilities make it a popular \n",
    "choice for a wide range of modern applications."
