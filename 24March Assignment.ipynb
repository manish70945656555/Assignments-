    "Ans:-The wine quality dataset contains 12 attributes that describe various physicochemical properties of red and white\n",

    "1.fixed acidity\n",

    "affects its body and overall flavor. Citric acid and residual sugar can impact the sweetness and fruitiness of wine, and\n",
    "sulphates can help preserve it. By analyzing these attributes, we can predict how good the wine is likely to taste and \n",

    "Q2. How did you handle missing data in the wine quality data set during the feature engineering process?\n",
    "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different imputation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The wine quality dataset does not contain any missing data, but in general, missing data can be handled in a few ways\n",
    "during feature engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Deleting rows or columns: This method removes any instances or features with missing values from the dataset. The\n",
    "advantage is that it is simple to implement and does not require imputing missing values. However, it can result in a \n",
    "loss of information, especially if a large percentage of the data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Imputation: This method involves replacing missing values with estimates based on other values in the dataset. There\n",
    "are different techniques for imputation, including mean imputation, median imputation, and regression imputation. \n",
    "The advantage of imputation is that it can preserve more information than simply deleting rows or columns. However, \n",
    "imputation can introduce bias if the missing data is not missing completely at random (MCAR).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Using a separate model: This method involves building a separate model to predict the missing values based on other\n",
    "features in the dataset. The advantage is that it can potentially provide more accurate estimates than simple imputation\n",
    "techniques. However, it can also be more complex to implement and may not be necessary for datasets with low amounts of\n",
    "missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the advantages and disadvantages of some common imputation techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Mean/median imputation:\n",
    "  - Advantages: easy to implement, preserves mean and variance of original variable, can work well for low percentages of \n",
    "    missing data\n",
    "  -Disadvantages: does not take into account relationships between variables, can result in biased estimates of standard error,\n",
    "   can reduce variance of imputed variable\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Regression imputation:\n",
    "  -Advantages: takes into account relationships between variables, can work well for MAR or MCAR missing data, can produce more\n",
    "   accurate estimates than mean/median imputation\n",
    "  -Disadvantages: assumes linear relationship between variables, can be computationally intensive for large amounts of missing\n",
    "   data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Multiple imputation:\n",
    "  -Advantages: produces more accurate estimates than single imputation methods, takes into account uncertainty in missing data,\n",
    "    allows for more complex imputation models\n",
    "  -Disadvantages: can be computationally intensive for large amounts of missing data, requires careful specification of imputation \n",
    "    model, can be difficult to combine results from multiple imputed datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Hot deck imputation:\n",
    "  -Advantages: can work well for MCAR or MAR missing data, preserves relationships between variables\n",
    "  -Disadvantages: assumes missing values are similar to other values in dataset, can be difficult to identify suitable donor \n",
    "    unit\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice of imputation technique should be based on the characteristics of the data and the research question. \n",
    "It is also recommended to conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results to different imputation methods.\n"

    "have equal influence in the model. This can be particularly important if some features have larger values than others, as\n",
    "they may otherwise dominate the model.\n",

    "the model. Common techniques for feature encoding include one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding.\n",

    "4.Feature generation: This involves creating new features from existing features, such as calculating the average grade\n",
    "across all subjects or the number of hours spent studying per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the student performance dataset, some specific transformations that could be used include:\n",

    "2.Encoding categorical variables such as the student's school, sex, and address.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Generating new features such as the average grade or the ratio of study time to free time.\n",
