    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric lies in how they measure the \n",
    "distance between data points in K-nearest neighbors (KNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Euclidean distance: It calculates the straight-line distance between two points in a multidimensional space. \n",
    "Mathematically, it is computed as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between corresponding coordinates\n",
    "of the two points. Euclidean distance considers the actual spatial distance between points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Manhattan distance: Also known as the city block distance or L1 distance, it measures the distance between two points \n",
    "by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates. It calculates the distance along the axes, resembling the\n",
    "distance traveled within a city block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in distance calculation affects the performance of the KNN classifier or regressor in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Sensitivity to feature scales: Euclidean distance is sensitive to the scale of features, as it calculates the distance\n",
    "based on the squared differences. If one feature has a larger scale than others, it can dominate the distance calculation.\n",
    "In contrast, Manhattan distance is not as sensitive to feature scales since it sums the absolute differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Influence of irrelevant features: Euclidean distance considers all features equally, which means irrelevant features \n",
    "may introduce noise and affect the accuracy of nearest neighbor identification. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, \n",
    "focuses on the differences along each axis independently, potentially reducing the influence of irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Decision boundaries: The choice of distance metric can lead to different decision boundaries. Euclidean distance tends \n",
    "to produce circular decision boundaries since it considers the overall spatial distance. In contrast, Manhattan distance\n",
    "can generate more rectangular decision boundaries due to its axis-specific measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the appropriate distance metric depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand. Euclidean distance is\n",
    "commonly used when the scale of features is meaningful and the spatial relationship between data points is relevant. \n",
    "Manhattan distance is suitable when feature scales are not significant, and the differences along each axis matter more.\n",
    "Experimentation and validation on the specific dataset are essential to determine which distance metric performs better."
