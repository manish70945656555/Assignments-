    "1.Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures noise and randomness in the training data, rather than the\n",

    "Q5: Discuss some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models.\n",

    "Ans:-Overfitting and underfitting are common problems in machine learning that occur when the model is too complex or too\n",
    "simple, respectively. Here are some common methods to detect overfitting and underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Train and test accuracy: One common method to detect overfitting and underfitting is to compare the accuracy of the model \n",
    "on the training data versus the accuracy on the test data. If the accuracy on the training data is significantly higher \n",
    "than the accuracy on the test data, the model may be overfitting. Conversely, if the accuracy on both the training and test data is low, the model may be underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Learning curves: A learning curve is a plot of the model's performance on the training and test data as a function of\n",
    "the number of training examples. If the learning curve for the training data shows a decreasing trend with increasing\n",
    "number of training examples, while the learning curve for the test data is stable, then the model may be overfitting. \n",
    "If both the learning curves are decreasing, then the model may be underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique that involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training \n",
    "the model on some subsets, and testing it on others. If the model performs well on the training subsets but poorly on the\n",
    "testing subsets, the model may be overfitting. Conversely, if the model performs poorly on both the training and testing \n",
    "subsets, the model may be underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Regularization: Regularization is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function of the model to discourage \n",
    "overfitting. If the regularization term is too high, the model may be underfitting. Conversely, if the regularization\n",
    "term is too low, the model may be overfitting.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out (sets to zero) a fraction of the neurons in the \n",
