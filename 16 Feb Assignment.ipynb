    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans:-A database is a collection of organized data that is structured in a way that enables efficient storage, retrieval, \n",
    "and management of information. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of data for a variety of applications \n",
    "and industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of database management systems that differ in how they organize and store\n",
    "data. Here are some of the key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, which means that data is organized into tables with predefined \n",
    "relationships between them. NoSQL databases use a non-relational data model, which means that data is stored in a more \n",
    "flexible and dynamic way, such as key-value pairs or documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to be more scalable than SQL databases, particularly for large-scale \n",
    "distributed systems. This is because NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or \n",
    "emi-structured data, while SQL databases are better suited for managing structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Query language: SQL databases use the SQL language to interact with the database, which is a standardized language for\n",
    "managing relational databases. NoSQL databases do not have a standardized query language, and instead use proprietary or\n",
    "custom query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.ACID compliance: SQL databases are typically designed to ensure that data is consistent and accurate, using the \n",
    "principles of ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability). NoSQL databases do not necessarily follow these \n",
    "principles, and instead may prioritize other characteristics like high availability or partition tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.In summary, SQL databases are better suited for applications that require strong consistency and well-defined\n",
    "relationships between data, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require high scalability,\n",
    "flexibility, and performance with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans:-DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and\n",

    "indexes, and constraints.\n",

    "\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key in mysql\n",

    "For example, consider two tables: \"employees\" and \"departments\". The \"employees\" table has a primary key of \"employee_id\",\\\n",
