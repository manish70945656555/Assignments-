    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique used for feature selection and regularization. Unlike traditional \n",
    "linear regression, Lasso Regression uses a penalty term that shrinks the coefficients of some of the features to zero, \n",
    "effectively removing them from the model. This penalty term is based on the absolute value of the coefficients, and it is\n",
    "controlled by a hyperparameter called alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression is more effective in selecting a subset of\n",
    "features that are most important for predicting the target variable. Ridge Regression shrinks all the coefficients towards \n",
    "zero, but it does not set any of them to exactly zero. On the other hand, Lasso Regression has the ability to completely \n",
    "eliminate some features, which can result in a more interpretable and efficient model."

    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can handle situations where there are many \n",
    "correlated features in the dataset. In such cases, traditional feature selection techniques, such as stepwise regression, can \n",
    "be unreliable because they may select one feature from a group of highly correlated features while ignoring the others. Lasso \n",
    "Regression, on the other hand, tends to select only one feature from a group of highly correlated features, which makes the \n",
    "model more stable and interpretable. Additionally, by shrinking the coefficients of some features to zero, Lasso Regression can\n",
    "help to reduce the risk of overfitting, which is a common problem in high-dimensional datasets."

    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "     The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model represent the relationship between each feature and the target variable, \n",
    "    after accounting for the effects of other features. The size and sign of each coefficient indicate the strength and \n",
    "    direction of the relationship. A positive coefficient means that an increase in the feature value is associated with an \n",
    "    increase in the target variable, while a negative coefficient means that an increase in the feature value is associated \n",
    "    with a decrease in the target variable. The magnitude of each coefficient represents the degree of influence of the feature\n",
    "    on the target variable, with larger coefficients indicating stronger effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that, in Lasso Regression, some coefficients may be shrunk to exactly zero, which means that the \n",
    "corresponding features have been excluded from the model. In this case, the coefficient of the excluded feature is effectively\n",

    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the\n",
    "model's performance?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "   The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter alpha, which controls the strength of the\n",
    "    penalty term that shrinks the coefficients towards zero. Higher values of alpha result in more aggressive shrinkage and \n",
    "    more coefficients being set to exactly zero, while lower values of alpha allow more coefficients to remain in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another tuning parameter that can be adjusted is the normalization of the features. Lasso Regression works best when the \n",
    "features are standardized (i.e., have mean zero and unit variance), so it's important to apply normalization before fitting\n",
    "the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, one can use cross-validation to select the optimal value of alpha. Cross-validation involves splitting the data\n",
    "into multiple folds, fitting the model on one fold and testing it on the other fold, and then repeating this process for all\n",
    "possible combinations of folds. This allows us to estimate the performance of the model for different values of alpha and \n",

    "\n",
    "The choice of tuning parameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. Choosing too high a value of \n",
    "alpha can result in underfitting, where the model is too simple and fails to capture important features. On the other hand, \n",
    "choosing too low a value of alpha can result in overfitting, where the model is too complex and fits the noise in the data as \n",
    "well as the signal. The optimal value of alpha depends on the specific dataset and should be chosen based on cross-validation \n",

    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique, which means it assumes a linear relationship between the features and the\n",
    "target variable. However, it is possible to use Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems by applying a non-linear\n",
    "transformation to the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is to use basis functions to transform the original features into a higher-dimensional space, where they can\n",
    "capture more complex relationships with the target variable. For example, we can use polynomial basis functions to transform a\n",
    "single feature x into a set of features [x, x^2, x^3, ...], which can model non-linear relationships between x and the target\n",
    "variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "After transforming the features, we can apply Lasso Regression as usual to select a subset of the basis functions and estimate\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice of basis functions can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. \n",
    "The basis functions should be chosen carefully based on domain knowledge and experimentation, and cross-validation should be\n",

    "The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression is the way they penalize the magnitude of the coefficients \n",

    "\n",
    "In Ridge Regression, a penalty term is added to the sum of squared residuals, which is proportional to the square of the \n",
    "magnitude of the coefficients. This penalty term is controlled by a hyperparameter λ (lambda), which determines the amount of \n",
    "shrinkage applied to the coefficients. As a result, Ridge Regression tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero but does \n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity refers to the situation where two or more predictor variables in a regression model are highly correlated\n",

    "Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",

    "\n",
    "One commonly used form of cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation. In k-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into \n",
