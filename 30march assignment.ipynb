    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Ans:- Elastic Net Regression is a type of regression analysis that combines the L1 and L2 regularization methods to achieve a\n",
    "balance between the bias and variance in a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional regression methods, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the\n",
    "actual values. However, in many cases, this can result in overfitting, where the model fits too closely to the training data\n",
    "and doesn't generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, regularization techniques are used, which add a penalty term to the objective function to discourage\n",
    "overfitting. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regression, adds a penalty term equal to the absolute value of the \n",
    "coefficients of the predictor variables. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regression, adds a penalty term equal to the\n",
    "square of the coefficients of the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression combines the L1 and L2 regularization methods by adding a penalty term that is a weighted average of \n",
    "the L1 and L2 penalty terms. The weights of the L1 and L2 penalty terms are controlled by a hyperparameter alpha, which \n",
    "determines the balance between the two types of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of Elastic Net Regression over other regression techniques is that it can handle datasets with a large\n",
    "number of predictor variables, where some of the predictor variables may be highly correlated. In such cases, Lasso regression\n",
    "tends to select one variable and ignore the others, while Ridge regression tends to shrink the coefficients of all the variables \n",
    "equally. Elastic Net Regression can select a subset of important predictor variables while still shrinking the coefficients of\n",
    "less important variables, resulting in a more parsimonious and interpretable model."

    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans:-To choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression, we typically use cross-validation.\n",
    "We first split the dataset into a training set and a validation set. Then, we train Elastic Net Regression models with \n",
    "different values of alpha and the regularization parameter lambda on the training set and evaluate their performance on the\n",

    "\n",
    "We can then choose the values of alpha and lambda that give the best performance on the validation set. The choice of the \n",
    "number of folds in the cross-validation process depends on the size of the dataset and the computational resources available.\n",
    "Generally, 5 or 10-fold cross-validation is used for smaller datasets, while 3-fold cross-validation is used for larger\n",
