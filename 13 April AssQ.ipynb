    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Random feature selection: At each split in a decision tree, only a subset of features is considered. This randomness prevents\n",
    "  individual trees from relying too heavily on a single feature and helps to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "2.Bootstrap sampling: Each tree in the ensemble is trained on a bootstrap sample (randomly sampled with replacement) from the\n",
    "  training data. This introduces variation and diversity in the training process, reducing the tendency to overfit to specific instances in the data.\n",
    "3.Ensemble averaging: The predictions from multiple trees are aggregated to make the final prediction. Averaging the predictions \n",
    "  helps to smooth out individual tree's idiosyncrasies and reduces the impact of outliers or noise in the data."
