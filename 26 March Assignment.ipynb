    "Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an\n",

    "Ans:-Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between two variables: one \n",
    "independent variable and one dependent variable. The independent variable (X) is used to predict the dependent variable \n",
    "(Y) using a linear equation (Y = a + bX), where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple linear regression could be used to predict the price of a house based on its square footage. In\n",
    "this case, the square footage would be the independent variable (X) and the price of the house would be the dependent \n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between multiple\n",

    "a linear equation (Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnXn) to the data.\n",

    "Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in\n",
    "a given dataset?\n",
    "Ans:-Linear regression makes certain assumptions about the data, which should be met for the regression analysis to be \n",
    "valid. The most common assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: There should be a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence: The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors (the difference between the predicted and actual values) should be constant\n",
    "across all levels of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Normality: The errors should be normally distributed, with a mean of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.No multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each\n",
    "other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, various diagnostic techniques can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Scatter plots: Scatter plots can be used to check the linearity assumption. The plot should show a clear linear\n",
    "relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Residual plots: Residual plots can be used to check the assumptions of independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. \n",
    "The residuals should be randomly scattered around the zero line, with no clear pattern or trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Normal probability plot: The normal probability plot can be used to check the assumption of normality. The plot should\n",

    "Q4. Explain the concept of gradient descent. How is it used in machine learning?\n",

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It is a widely used algorithm in\n",
    "machine learning, particularly in training models for regression and classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind gradient descent is to iteratively update the parameters of a model to minimize the difference\n",

    "function with respect to the parameters, and then updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two main types of gradient descent: batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. In batch gradient \n",
    "descent, the entire dataset is used to calculate the gradient, while in stochastic gradient descent, a randomly selected\n",
    "subset (or mini-batch) of the dataset is used to calculate the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent algorithm involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Initialize the parameters of the model to random values.\n",
    "2.Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "3.Update the parameters by subtracting the gradient multiplied by a learning rate.\n",
    "4.Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence (when the cost function is minimized).\n",

    "The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size taken in each iteration of the algorithm. A larger\n",
