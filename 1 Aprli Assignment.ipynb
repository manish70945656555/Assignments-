    "Q1. Explain the difference between linear regression and logistic regression models. Provide an example of\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:- Linear regression and logistic regression are both types of supervised learning algorithms used in machine learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to predict a person's salary based on their years of experience. In this case, linear\n",
    "regression would be appropriate because the response variable (salary) is a continuous variable.\n",

    "On the other hand, suppose you want to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not based on their age, gender, \n",

    "J(w) = -(1/m) * sum(yi*log(h(xi)) + (1-yi)*log(1-h(xi)))\n",

    "Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Regularization is a technique used in logistic regression to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model\n",

    "Ans:- There are several issues and challenges that may arise when implementing logistic regression, and some common ones\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Multicollinearity: This occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "Multicollinearity can cause the coefficients to be unstable and difficult to interpret. One way to address multicollinearity \n",

    "2.Outliers: Outliers can have a significant impact on the logistic regression model and can distort the results. One way\n",
    "to address outliers is to use robust regression techniques, such as weighted least squares or robust regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Non-linearity: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of\n",
    "the response variable. If this assumption is violated, it can lead to poor model performance. Non-linear relationships\n",
    "can be addressed by transforming the independent variables or using non-linear regression models.\n",

    "4.Missing data: Missing data can lead to biased estimates and reduce the power of the analysis. One way to address missing\n",
    "data is to use multiple imputation techniques to impute the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely. This can lead to \n",
    "poor generalization to new data. Overfitting can be addressed by using regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization,\n",
    "or by reducing the number of features in the model using feature selection techniques.\n",
