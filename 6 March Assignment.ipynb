    "Descriptive statistics deals with summarizing and describing data. It includes methods for calculating measures of central \n",

    "1.Mean: The arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the \n",

    "    \n",
    "Some common measures of variability are:\n",

    "3.Standard deviation: The square root of the variance. It measures the typical distance between each value and the mean. It is\n",
