    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",

    "      House is the object.Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.\n",

    "             world and hide the other irrelevant information. For example to open our TV we only have a power button, \n",
    "             It is not required to understand how infra-red waves are getting generated in TV remote control.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Encapsulation : Encapsulation means wrapping up data and member function (Method) together into a single unit i.e. class.\n",
    "                Encapsulation automatically achieve the concept of data hiding providing security to data by making the\n",
    "                variable as private and expose the property to access the private data which would be public.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Inheritance : The ability of creating a new class from an existing class. Inheritance is when an object acquires the \n",
    "              property of another object. Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to acquire the properties and behavior of \n",
    "              another class (super-class). It helps to reuse, customize and enhance the existing code. So it helps to write\n",
    "              a code accurately and reduce the development time.\n",
    "            \n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word \"poly\" means many and \"morphs\" \n",
    "             means forms. So polymorphism means \"many forms\". A subclass can define its own unique behavior and still share\n",
