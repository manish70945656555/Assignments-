    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Grid search cross-validation (CV) is a hyperparameter tuning technique in machine learning that is used to find the\n",
    "best combination of hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the training \n",
    "process begins, such as the learning rate, regularization strength, or number of hidden layers in a neural network. The\n",
    "purpose of grid search CV is to systematically search through a range of hyperparameter values and evaluate the model's \n",
    "performance on a validation set using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by defining a grid of hyperparameter values to search over. For example, if we are tuning the \n",
    "learning rate and regularization strength, we might define a grid with learning rates [0.001, 0.01, 0.1] and regularization\n",
    "strengths [0.1, 1, 10]. The grid search algorithm then trains and evaluates the model for each combination of hyperparameters \n",
    "in the grid, using k-fold cross-validation to estimate the model's performance on unseen data. The best combination of \n",
    "hyperparameters is then selected based on the average performance across all folds."

    "Q2. Describe the difference between grid search cv and randomize search cv, and when might you choose\n",
    "one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Randomized search CV is similar to grid search CV in that it is also used for hyperparameter tuning, but instead of \n",
    "evaluating all possible combinations of hyperparameters in a grid, it randomly samples a subset of hyperparameters from \n",
    "a defined range. Randomized search CV can be faster and more efficient than grid search CV, especially when the number \n",
    "of hyperparameters or the range of values is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between grid search CV and randomized search CV depends on the specific problem and the number of hyperparameters\n",
    "being tuned. If the hyperparameters to be tuned are relatively few and the range of values is not too large, grid search\n",
    "CV can be a good option. However, if the hyperparameters are numerous or the range of values is large, randomized search\n",
    "CV can be a more efficient approach. In general, randomized search CV is a good option when we don't have any prior\n",

    "4.Avoid using information from the test or validation data: Make sure that the model is not trained on any information \n",
