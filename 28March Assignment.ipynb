    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that uses L2 regularization to overcome the overfitting problem in ordinary\n",
    "least squares regression. In Ridge Regression, the sum of squared residuals (SSR) is minimized along with a penalty term \n",
    "proportional to the sum of squared coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function of Ridge Regression can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "minimize SSR + alpha * (sum of squared coefficients)\n",
    "\n",
    "where alpha is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the penalty term. By adding this penalty term, Ridge Regression \n",
    "shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing the model's complexity and making it less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ordinary least squares regression does not include any penalty term, and the objective is to minimize only the \n",
    "SSR. Hence, it is more likely to overfit the data, especially when there are many features and a limited number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Ridge Regression can produce more robust and generalized models than ordinary least squares regression, especially \n",
    "when dealing with high-dimensional data."

    "Ans:-\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that is based on some assumptions about the data. The key assumptions of\n",
    "Ridge Regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence: The observations are assumed to be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Normality: The residuals are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and constant variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Homoscedasticity: The residuals are assumed to have constant variance across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.No multicollinearity: The independent variables are assumed to be uncorrelated with each other. In case of multicollinearity,\n",
    "Ridge Regression can help to reduce the impact of correlated variables on the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these assumptions are important for the validity of the Ridge Regression model, they may not always hold in practice.\n",
    "Therefore, it is essential to check these assumptions before applying the Ridge Regression model to real-world data."

    "Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-In Ridge Regression, the tuning parameter lambda (also known as alpha) controls the strength of the penalty term. A higher\n",
    "value of lambda will result in stronger regularization, which will shrink the regression coefficients more towards zero. On \n",

    "Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection by shrinking the regression coefficients of the less important features \n",

    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that Ridge Regression does not perform exact feature selection as it shrinks the coefficients\n",
